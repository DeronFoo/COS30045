                <h1>Contextual Background</h1>
                <p>Air pollution is a pressing issue, affecting millions worldwide and linked to severe health impacts, climate change, and environmental degradation. Southeast Asia, with its dense populations and rapid industrialization, faces unique challenges due to high levels of emissions from various sources, such as fossil fuel combustion, industrial activities, and vehicular emissions. This visualization project delves into the air quality data of Southeast Asia, exploring the origins, extent, and consequences of pollution. By examining these trends and impacts, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the need for sustainable solutions to promote healthier communities and a cleaner environment.</p>

            <h1>Aim & Objectives</h2>
            <p>To create an informative and engaging visualization that illustrates the air pollution trends, health impacts, and potential solutions in Southeast Asia. The project empowers audiences, especially policymakers, environmental advocates, and the general public, to understand and advocate for cleaner air across the region.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Integration</strong> – Consolidate comprehensive data on air pollution, including pollutant levels, sources, and health outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Trend Analysis</strong> – Visualize temporal changes in air quality across Southeast Asia, highlighting key trends and anomalies.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Impact Correlation</strong> – Illustrate correlations between pollution levels and public health data to show the consequences of poor air quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution Highlighting</strong> – Present actionable solutions and policies that can reduce pollution and protect community health.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement</strong> – Create an interactive experience that allows audiences to explore and interpret the data in a meaningful way.</li>

                    <p class="intro-text">
                        <strong>Air Quality Index (AQI)</strong>: This index represents the level of air pollution based on key measurements of particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). Most monitoring stations report both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> data, though some report only PM<sub>10</sub>. The AQI helps us understand air quality in real-time, translating complex pollution data into values and categories ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous."
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-text">
                        Observations show that air quality varies significantly across the globe, influenced by industrial activities, urbanization, transportation, and environmental regulations. In regions with high AQI values, pollution poses significant health risks, affecting respiratory health, cardiovascular conditions, and increasing mortality rates. Monitoring and understanding global AQI is vital to identifying areas in need of intervention and guiding policy actions that protect public health and the environment.
